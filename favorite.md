Initiatially, my preferred text editor was nano, but that quickly changed after I began using vi. I like how you create/open a file by typing vi file name. It's a very simple and easy way for me to know how to get started. Then to start amanipulating or creating new text, you just have to type "i" for Insert mode and then Esp to exit back to command mode. It's also easier for me to remember to usecolon (:) and then the letter(s) for what you want to do next. In my opinion, vi is much more straightforward and easier to use, in relationship to emacs and nano.
