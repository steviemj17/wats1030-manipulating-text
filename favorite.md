Initially, my preferred text editor was nano until I started using vi. I really like vi compared to the other two text editors because the command usage is simpler and easier to remember. From the beginning when you have to create/open a file, I like that you just have to type: vi file name. And then when the file opens, you simply just type "i" to manipulate text. Using comma : plus the letter(s) is much more straighforward and an easy way to remember the commands v a more ccomplex emacs text editor.
