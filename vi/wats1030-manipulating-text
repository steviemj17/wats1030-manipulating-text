Initially, my preferred text editor was nano, but quickly changed my mind when I began using the vi text editor for this assignment. I like the way files are created in vi: on the command line you type vi file name. For me, that first step is more user friendly. When the file opens up, I also like that you have to type "i" for insert, to begin manipulating the text. After you hit esp to go back to command mode, I like the method of typing the : before whatever command letter you want to initiate. Vi, in my opinion, is easier to navigate through and the eeasier to remember.
